# NarrativeJS


## features with Neutralino
- index_comp.html tests completion and the most advanced NEventArray
- index_console.html has a preliminary version of console + graph
- index_yaml.html tested YAML and JSON strigify and load/save
- nodejs ntest_idate.js : tests for IDate

## features in pure HTML (for test)
- in app/assets : test_story.html => new Story compatible with VIS and some REACT components

## config
Use ./config <label> where a app/index_label.html file exists

## Depends on

- app/assets/text-area-caret-position.js link to ComponentJS/textarea-caret-position/index.js [Project ComponentJS : https://github.com/component/textarea-caret-position]
- (needs vis.js)
- (tries js-yaml.js, but not working)
- (tries and test react)
